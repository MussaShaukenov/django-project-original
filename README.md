					Project Proposal

a. Our project is COVID-19 Forecasting in Kazakhstan Website.  a. COVID-19 is the most relevant problem of our society right now. COVID-19 made huge issues to our humanity for almost a year. Everyday lots of people around the world deal with COVID-19. Although there are lots of problems beyond coronavirus, we think it is the problem that has to be solved as fast as possible. That’s why, we decided to help Kazakhstan’s population to keep in touch with it. That is why we decided to make a website about it. We believe that such website with Forecasting system somehow will prevent people for going somewhere if there is no need. Being at home during big numbers of infected people would be good for people because they will be safe. However, knowing the approximate number of infected people in the future would be more important because we could cover more amount of humanity from being infected. This is a primary goal of what our website does.

b. We make a website. There are no analogues for our website in Kazakhstani arena. The only concurrent that the website has it is official website of COVID-19 that merely displays on the main page the numbers of infected, recovered people and number of deaths. Another interesting feature of that website is F.A.Q. section. However, there are no more interesting features. In our opinion, it is not enough. We believe that the presence of forecasting system is essential in such websites. People can see the graph with changes in numbers throughout days and can see the upcoming days and numbers of infected, recovered people. In the official COVID-19 website, all data is in the table. But we think using linear and bar chart graphs would be more attractive that usual table. Additionally, when people see the graph they can choose the date or the range of days and can analyse and predict by themselves.

c. Our major target authority is Kazakhstani population who are worried about the current and future situations of COVID-19 in their cities. 
The minority of users are people who are interested in websites’ design. They can find interesting and fascinating some aspects of our website.

d. Our website has Front-end and Back-end. The front-end would done using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and Bootstrap4. The front-end contains header, main and footer parts. In the header part, the website has logo, sections. Our main part contains data and graph with forecasting system, some fresh articles and etc. The footer part contains references and links.

The back-end part is done using Python’s framework - Django. Website has its own Database that has the numbers of infected, recovered people and number of deaths. Data is being added by web scraping technology from Official website of COVID-19 in Kazakhstan. 

From less important features website would contain section for articles about coronavirus. Right now, the most important news in coronavirus sphere is vaccination. That’s why, many articles would be about this topic. 

Our website does not have financial budget. The main goals of the website are to help Kazakhstani population to struggle with coronavirus and to save stipend. If we would have enough time, we add Donate section where people can support our project. The 50% of the Donated money would go to the WHO(World Health Organisation) in Kazakhstan in order to struggle with it. The rest of 50% would go to the authors: Mussa Shaukenov and Sultan Aimagambet.
